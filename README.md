# Recommendation-Engine
Recommendation Engine for IBM Watson Studio platform articles for Users on real data provided by Udacity. Data analyzed then using Rank Based Recommendations, User-User Based Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization I managed to provide users new articles to keep enjoying and make the best use at the platform.

# Steps in the Jupyter Notebook

1. Exploratory Data Analysis EDA
To know more about the data provided in both datasets, the user interaction with the aricles and remove any duplicates.

2. Rank Based Recommendations
To get started in building recommendations, first we got the most popular articles simply based on the most interactions. Since there are no ratings for any of the articles, I will provide the most interacted articles with as a rank.

3. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
In order to build better recommendations for the users of IBM's platform, we could recommand based on similar users interaction as a way to make a recommandation based on collaboration which could lead to be more personalized recommendation.

4. Matrix Factorization
Using machine learning approach in seperating traing and testing datasets in building recommendations using SVD to build user-item Matrix.
